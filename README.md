Here I have kept my code for some projects. Generally, I find it quite enjoyable to make game projects. 
That's why most of my projects are games. I did not find it easy to create these projects. The code had many problems, so I had to do a lot of debugging. 
After debugging and testing extensively, I made them as flawless as I could. I also added explanations of statements where necessary to make them more understandable.
